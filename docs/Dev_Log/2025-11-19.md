# Dev Log — November 19, 2025

Role: DevOps / Backend Developer  

Today I began the technical setup for the Q-Fit Workout Tracker backend environment. I SSH’d into my AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance and confirmed the server connection was stable. My goal for the day was to verify the Tomcat installation from my previous Assignment 2 and ensure the environment is clean enough to build the new team project on. I ran `sudo find / -type d -name "tomcat*" 2>/dev/null` to search the entire server for Tomcat directories, because the default `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps` folder did not exist. The results showed multiple Tomcat-related folders, including `/opt/tomcat9`, `/opt/tomcat9.bak`, `/usr/share/tomcat9`, and the active systemd service folder. This confirmed that my Tomcat installation was done manually under `/opt/tomcat9` during Assignment 2, which is fully valid and expected since manual installations give more control.

After locating the installation, I checked the contents of the Tomcat webapps directory using `ls -l /opt/tomcat9/webapps`. The directory contained the default Tomcat applications (ROOT, manager, docs, examples) as well as my Assignment 2 deployment (`DBTest` and `DBTest.war`). A few standalone files like `dbok.jsp` and `index.html` were also present, but nothing unusual or harmful. Overall, the structure was clean enough to reuse without resetting the server.

Next, I verified Tomcat’s health using `sudo systemctl status tomcat9`. The service showed as active (running), using Java 17, and had been stable for over two weeks with no error logs. This confirmed the server is in a good, reliable state and suitable for the final project. I also reviewed my AWS Security Group rules, which allow inbound traffic for ports 22, 80, and 8080—the exact ports needed for SSH, Apache, and Tomcat.

The main observation from today is that my Tomcat installation is non-standard (located under `/opt/tomcat9` instead of the package-managed `/var/lib/tomcat9`), but this is actually beneficial because it gives me full control over configurations, deployments, and WAR file management. All future deployments for the Q-Fit project must use `/opt/tomcat9/webapps`.

With the environment verified and no blockers, my next steps will be to create a dedicated QFit folder under `/opt/tomcat9/webapps`, prepare the `WEB-INF` structure, link Eclipse to Tomcat for local development, and build a simple “HelloServlet” to test deployment before moving into main servlets like login and workout logging. The backend environment is officially ready for development.
