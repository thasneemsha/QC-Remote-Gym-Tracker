Updated Coach Stakeholder Requirements (with API Integration)
 Coach Requirements – SR2.x (Updated for API Integration)
SR2.1 – Coaches shall be able to view users’ workout history, including exercises, sets, reps, weight, and notes.
SR2.2 – Coaches shall be able to access workout data through API endpoints, enabling future use in dashboards or mobile apps.
SR2.3 – Coaches shall be able to analyze progress trends using data retrieved from API endpoints.
SR2.4 – Coaches shall be able to submit written feedback tied to user workouts, using either the web interface or an API request.
SR2.5 – Coaches shall be able to view feedback history for a student, fetched through the API for consistency across platforms.
SR2.6 – Coaches shall receive streamlined access to user performance indicators (consistency, volume progression, PR trends) via standardized API data structures.

What Changed?
Your old coach requirements assumed everything would occur through JSP pages.
But NOW WITH THE API usage, the Coach role must:
Retrieve workout history via API (SR2.2)
Retrieve progress trends via API (SR2.3)
Use API for feedback (SR2.4, SR2.5)
Use standardized JSON/API data to view metrics (SR2.6)
This matches your new API-focused design philosophy.

Admin Requirements — SR3.x (Updated With API Integration)
SR3.1 – View All Users (API-Ready)
Admin shall be able to view all user accounts, including email, role, and account status.
SR3.2 – Activate / Deactivate Users
Admin shall be able to change user account status (active/inactive).
The update operation shall be available via:
Admin web interface
A protected API endpoint such as:
PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/status
SR3.3 – Reset User Passwords
Admin shall be able to reset a user’s password through UI actions or by invoking a secure API endpoint.
Example API structure:
POST /api/admin/users/{id}/reset-password
SR3.4 – Manage System Roles via API
Admin shall be able to assign or update user roles (User, Coach, Admin).
This may be exposed through an API endpoint returning role metadata and accepting role updates.
SR3.5 – View System-Wide Metrics (Analytics API)
Admin shall be able to view application-level statistics such as:
number of active users
total workouts logged
weekly usage totals
coach feedback activity
These metrics will be delivered through analytics API endpoints returning structured JSON.
SR3.6 – Access System Logs (API-Focused)
Admin shall be able to access error logs, event logs, and key activity logs via API calls for monitoring and debugging.
SR3.7 – Support for External Integrations
Admin requirements include enabling access tokens or API keys so that future integrations (mobile app, dashboards) can authenticate with the QFit API layer.
 
What Changed in the Admin Stakeholder Requirements (API Integration)

Admin features now support API endpoints in addition to UI screens.
Activate/Deactivate account functionality now uses secure PUT/POST API requests, not just form submissions.
Password reset is now handled through a protected API endpoint, making the system compatible with mobile apps or external admin tools.
Role management (User/Coach/Admin) is fully API-driven, allowing updates via backend scripts or admin dashboards.
System-wide metrics are now retrieved through Analytics API endpoints that return workout totals, activity levels, and usage statistics.
Admins now have API-level access to system logs (errors, events, system health), enabling realistic monitoring and debugging workflows.
Support for external integrations was added, meaning Admins can manage API keys or tokens for third-party applications.
Overall: Admin functionality has been modernized to reflect real software engineering practices, allowing both UI and API-driven control of the platform.
