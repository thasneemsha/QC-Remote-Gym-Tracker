## Interview Questions and Answers

### Interview 1 (Thasneem)

**Q1: What problem are you trying to solve with a workout app?**  
**A1:** I want a planner/log that supports both a web app and a mobile app. I need something that helps me plan workout days and individual sessions.

**Q2: Why is a web app important to you?**  
**A2:** Planning takes time for me and it's much easier to do on a computer. I want to build my workouts on a web interface.

**Q3: What level of customization do you need for workouts?**  
**A3:** I need very custom workouts — the ability to define supersets, intervals (fully custom workouts). And I need to enter reps, weights, and times directly into the app during workouts.

**Q4: Are there any features you don't need or care about?**  
**A4:** I don’t need built-in workout programs, predefined exercises in the library, or automatic exercise tracking functionality.

**Q5: Why are you looking for a custom workout planner instead of using major platforms like Apple Fitness or Fitbit?**  
**A5:** Those platforms are cool but they're not what I need. They're mostly for general fitness or step counting, and they don’t let me plan specific workouts the  way I want. I have different routines like free diving, running, and strength training, and I want to organize everything myself—especially on a computer.

### Interview 2 (Sonu)

### **Interview: Gym Member (Student User)**

**Q1. How often do you work out and what motivates you to track your progress?**
