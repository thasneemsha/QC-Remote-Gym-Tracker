Interview 1:( i got this from reddit, but it works for our project, we can change this to a Q/A type

Is there a workout planner/log with both: web and mobile app?

I try to combine 3 different training types: free diving, running & strength training. I was looking for any app that can help me to plan my workouts and workout days, but without any luck.

I just want to: Plan my workouts on my computer using web app (it takes time for me to plan everything and it's much easier to do it at the computer)
1. Be able to define workouts as custom as I would like (supersets, intervals etc.)
2. Have a mobile app to see the workout
3. Ability to input reps, weights, times in the mobile app.

I don't need to have:
1. any predefined workout programs
2. any predefined exercises
3. any timers or exercise tracking
