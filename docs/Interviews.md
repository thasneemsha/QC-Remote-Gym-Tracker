# User Interview Summary
 
The interviewed gym users expressed that their top priority is simplicity and speed. Most students work out between classes or after long days, so they want a workout tracker that requires minimal typing and feels fast to use. They emphasized that many fitness apps are too complicated, which discourages them from logging workouts consistently.
 
Users said they want a clean and simple logging form where they can quickly input exercise name, sets, reps, and weight without navigating multiple screens. This supports the need for a lightweight, student-friendly workout logging flow.
 
Another major theme was the importance of visual progress. Students mentioned that they stay more motivated when they can clearly see how their workouts are improving. They requested simple charts, such as weekly workout volume, lift progress over time, and consistency streaks.
 
Users also said they struggle with consistency, especially during exam weeks. Many expressed that optional reminders after a few days of inactivity would help them stay on track without feeling intrusive.
 
Goal-setting also came up frequently. Students often set specific strength goals and want the app to support creating and tracking these goals.
 
Finally, users stated that privacy is important. They want full control over their workout data and prefer that their history remain private unless they choose to share it. Some were open to optional coach feedback, but only as an add-on.
