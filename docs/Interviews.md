# User Interview Summary

The interviewed user is a QC student who works out 3–4 times per week and wants a simple way to track their strength progression over time. The user currently records exercise name, sets, reps, weight, and occasional performance notes. They want the app to help them stay consistent, motivated, and visually aware of their progress.

The user explained that they want clear visual data such as weekly workout volume, personal record milestones, and charts showing how their lifts are improving. They also said that getting reminders after several days of inactivity would help them remain accountable to their routine.

Goal-setting is an important part of their workout approach. The user commonly sets personal milestones (e.g., benching 135 lbs or squatting 225 lbs) and wants the app to support tracking these goals over time.

The user prefers a simple interface that allows fast workout logging with minimal typing. They value clean charts that update immediately after saving a workout. They also mentioned they would consider paying a small student-friendly subscription ($2–3/month) for more advanced analytics or optional coach feedback.
