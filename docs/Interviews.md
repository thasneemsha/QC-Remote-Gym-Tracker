# User Interview Summary
 
The interviewed gym users expressed that their top priority is simplicity and speed. Most students work out between classes or after long days, so they want a workout tracker that requires minimal typing and feels fast to use. They emphasized that many fitness apps are too complicated, which discourages them from logging workouts consistently.
 
Users said they want a clean and simple logging form where they can quickly input exercise name, sets, reps, and weight without navigating multiple screens. This supports the need for a lightweight, student-friendly workout logging flow.
 
Another major theme was the importance of visual progress. Students mentioned that they stay more motivated when they can clearly see how their workouts are improving. They requested simple charts, such as weekly workout volume, lift progress over time, and consistency streaks.
 
Users also said they struggle with consistency, especially during exam weeks. Many expressed that optional reminders after a few days of inactivity would help them stay on track without feeling intrusive.
 
Goal-setting also came up frequently. Students often set specific strength goals and want the app to support creating and tracking these goals.
 
Finally, users stated that privacy is important. They want full control over their workout data and prefer that their history remain private unless they choose to share it. Some were open to optional coach feedback, but only as an add-on.

As part of my testing and review responsibilities, I contributed to refining the application’s interface, providing detailed feedback on the homepage, registration form, and dashboard to enhance usability, clarity, and user interaction. For the homepage, I recommended including essential elements such as Email or Phone Number, Password, Log In, Forgot Account?, Create New Account, and ensuring clear navigation for both returning and new users.

For the registration form, I suggested a user-friendly layout with Create a New Account, It’s Quick and Easy, First Name, Last Name, Birthday, Gender (Female, Male, Custom), Mobile Number or Email, New Password, Sign Up, Already Have an Account?, and the QC Front and Back ID photos to streamline identity verification.

I collaborated with Thasneemsha to review these UI components, identifying potential usability issues and improvements. In today’s meeting with Bryan, I provided solutions to optimize navigation and structure, documented feedback, and ensured designs aligned with functional requirements. These contributions guided the team toward a consistent, user-focused, and secure interface, with recommendations for usability testing and responsive design validation.
