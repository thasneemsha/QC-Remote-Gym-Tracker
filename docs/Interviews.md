User Interview Summary

The interviewed gym users emphasized that their top priorities are simplicity and speed. Students often work out between classes and want a workout tracker that requires minimal typing and feels quick to use. Many mentioned that complicated fitness apps discourage consistent logging.

Users also expressed the need for a clean, straightforward logging flow where they can easily enter exercise name, sets, reps, weight, and optional notes without navigating multiple screens.

A recurring theme was the importance of visual progress. Users stay more motivated when they can clearly see improvements over time. They requested simple charts such as weekly training volume, personal records (PRs), and strength progression lines.

Many students struggle with consistency, especially during exam weeks, and said that optional inactivity reminders would help them stay on track without feeling intrusive.

Goal-setting was also important. Users set personal strength targets and want the app to help them create and track these goals easily.

Finally, users highlighted privacy. They want full control over their workout history and prefer their data to remain private unless they choose to share it.

As part of my testing and review responsibilities, I contributed to refining the application’s interface, providing detailed feedback on the homepage, registration form, and dashboard to enhance usability, clarity, and user interaction. For the homepage, I recommended including essential elements such as Email or Phone Number, Password, Log In, Forgot Account?, Create New Account, and ensuring clear navigation for both returning and new users.

For the registration form, I suggested a user-friendly layout with Create a New Account, It’s Quick and Easy, First Name, Last Name, Birthday, Gender (Female, Male, Custom), Mobile Number or Email, New Password, Sign Up, Already Have an Account?, and the QC Front and Back ID photos to streamline identity verification.

I collaborated with Thasneemsha to review these UI components, identifying potential usability issues and improvements. In today’s meeting with Bryan, I provided solutions to optimize navigation and structure, documented feedback, and ensured designs aligned with functional requirements. These contributions guided the team toward a consistent, user-focused, and secure interface, with recommendations for usability testing and responsive design validation.
